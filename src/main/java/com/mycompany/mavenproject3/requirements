1. head interface to monitor the library, faculty, and learners.
    - be able to view the information of a specific faculty member and be able to view in a list or individual faculty member and the list must only show the ID and the full name of the faculty member when in list only.
    - this one does not consist of a register function. it is already set and the password is head123.

2. added self-assigning feature for learner.
    - this function will include a system that allows a learner to assign themselves to a section.
    - the section's person capacity is capped at 40, and there are 5 sections.
    - learner must select a section permanently.

3. extension from the new feature to the faculty.

6. make the entire program schematics to revolve around the self-assigning feature.
    - for the faculty member, revise the functions where it must first have separate interface functions to select from, namely for learners and materials in switch case values.
    - for the learner interface for the learners, it must first be prompted to select a section to marshal before viewing, editing, and deleting etc. the learners. and everyone in the section that the learners have selected to enter, the faculty member has full control of viewing, editing, and deleting the learners.
